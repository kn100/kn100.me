<p>This project provides you with two main scripts. The first is a player controller which was designed with the Oculus Rift DK2 in mind, but should work perfectly with more modern hardware. This player controller will attempt to keep the player locked to the surface of whatever three dimensional shape they are walking on, similar to Super Mario Galaxy.<br>

<h2>Assets</h2>
<h3>A player controller that:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allows for forwards, backwards, and rotation motion</li>
<li>Keeps the player locked to the surface of any given geometry, provided that it has a mesh collider (Think Super Mario Galaxy)</li>
<li>Is compatible with VR headsets - tested with Oculus Home and Rift DK2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Virtual Reality User Interface controller script that:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implements a gaze pointer type interface, where the user looks at three dimensional objects in order to select them</li>
<li>Follows Googles’ guidelines on VR interfaces</li>
<li>Describes an interface (IObjectAction) that can be implemented in scripts attached to 3D objects either generated during development or pragmatically, to allow for totally new interfaces</li>
<li>Implements a non-blocking timer that is used to decide if the user has been looking at an element long enough</li>
<li>Displays said timer in three dimensional space to the user wearing the headset.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
To get started</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Open the ‘World Explorer’ folder within the repo as a project with Unity.</li>
<li>Hit Play in Unity and use your standard method of control! Feel free to build on this scene.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Implementation details<h2>
<h3>Creating a new scene</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a Capsule, and give it a Rigidbody, disabling Gravity. Add a Camera as a child of this Capsule and ensure its’ position is set sensibly; (0,0,0) is usually a good bet.</li>
<li>Attach the genericWalker script provided to this Capsule.</li>
<li>If user interface is desired, Firstly attach CameraLookAtUI to the player camera.</li>
<li>Tag the game object you wish to do something if the user looks at it with either “Major” or “Minor”. This distinction allows you to set two separate activation delays for these two different classes of object.</li>
<li>To define the action you want to take place when the game object is looked at, Create a new C# script called whatever you like, and implement IObjectAction, concretely defining activate() - where your action takes place.<br>
</ol>
<h4>Example</h4>
<pre><code>    Example which selects a different scene:

    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

    public class goHome : MonoBehaviour,IObjectAction
    {
    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update () {

    }
    public void activate()
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene(0);
    }
</code></pre>
